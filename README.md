# cra-template-qwe

My daily use template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Usage

To use this template within your project, add `--template qwe` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template qwe
# or
yarn create react-app my-app --template qwe
```

Cloning this repo pulls down the Redux template only; not a bundled and configured Create React App.
